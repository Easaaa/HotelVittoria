# HotelVittoria

A Hotel web site that i made for a business of my home town village.

This is my second web site and my first one with several pages. 
Thanks to Wes Bos that has helped me a lot with the CSS grid course. (https://cssgrid.io/)
Thanks to DARK CODE channel on you tube for specials tips on how to style some stuff.
